Are you a fan of the Naruto anime and manga series? Are you looking for a comprehensive resource that can provide you with all the information you need about the characters, clans, villages, teams, Akatsuki, Kara, kekkei-genkai, and Tailed-beasts in the Naruto universe? Look no further than the Naruto DB!

We are excited to announce the launch of the [Naruto DB](https://www.narutodb.xyz/), a free resource that provides detailed information about the Naruto universe. With this API, you can easily retrieve information about your favourite characters and explore the rich lore and world-building of the Naruto universe.

The Naruto API is designed to be easy to use and flexible. Simply make a GET request to the appropriate endpoint with the required parameters, and the API will return all available information about the requested resource in JSON format.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
        'https://api.narutodb.xyz/character' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```
