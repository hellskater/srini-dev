# Deploying a Next app to AWS EC2 with GitHub actions CI/CD

First of all, there are plenty of other _easy_ and _faster_ ways to deploy your next app, like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), where you can get it up and running in a matter of seconds. So if it's a personal project or a small one, feel free to try those out.

If you're still here and you want to deploy your own app end to end yourself, in your own managed server in AWS, then let's jump right into the code üöÄ. We'll go through every single step until our app is online.

<Callout type="note">
  I will be using a Mac machine for this tutorial, there won't be much
  difference if you are on Windows, I'll mention some links to other articles if
  some of the steps are different.
</Callout>

## Creating the Next project

If you are here for the deployment then most likely you already have a Next app ready, if not, then I guess you might wanna do that 1st?

Head over [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) and set up your first Next project.

### Pushing the project to GitHub

Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/), sign up/log in and create a new repository and copy the https link.

  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

Move inside your project folder and run these commands

```zsh
git init
```

If you used `create-next-app` to initialise your project then you must already have a `.git` folder, in that case you don't need to run the above command. Start from the following.

```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "initial project"
git remote add origin \<YOUR COPIED HTTPS URL\>
git push origin main
```

Head over to your repository in GitHub and you can see your project files there ‚ú®.

## Launching an EC2 instance

Now we're not gonna go through how to create a new account in AWS, you can check the official [docs](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) of AWS, they have a detailed step by step guide.

Now assuming that you've set up your account and logged in.
Go to `Services -> EC2 -> Launch Instance`

**_Only change the fields that we discuss here, leave everything as it is by default_**

1. Type a name for your instance and select `Ubuntu` in AMI.

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668512119686/g5_cemCv1.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

2. Click on `create a new key pair`, type a name for your key pair and click on `Create
key pair`.

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668512375463/6B_4j0M4k.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>
**_Please don't lose your key pair file, or you won't able to access your instance_**

3. In `Network Settings`, click on `Create security group` and check `Allow SSH` from `Anywhere`, `Allow HTTPS` and `Allow HTTP`.

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668512632515/QsMPizKPJ.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

4. In `Network Settings`, click on `Edit`

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668517706069/93r-fVoNN.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

Scroll to the bottom of `Network Settings` and click on `Add security group role`

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668517860612/QhsqQ1NoK.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

In the new security group rule, in `Port range` type `3000`, in `Source` select `0.0.0.0/0`

5. In `Configure storage`, create `20 GiB` of volume.

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668512728915/KB4kmCIjH.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

That's it. Now click on `Launch instance`. And you have an instance running. üöÄ

## Logging into our EC2 instance

Now that we have our instance up and running, we need to get inside it to set up our server, which we are gonna do using SSH.

Go to `Services -> EC2 -> Instances` and click on your newly created instance.

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668513098913/sgSrmHp-X.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

Now copy your `Public IPv4 DNS` address, which we will use to log into our instance

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668513248445/qYU-bqfak.png"
  alt="aws ec2 instance screenshot"
/>

<Callout type="note">
  If you are on a windows PC then skip the next few steps to log into the
  instance and checkout
  [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)
</Callout>

Now, for **Mac** users, open your terminal and `cd` into the directory where you have downloaded your \<YOUR-KEY-NAME\>.pem, and type the following commands

```zsh
chmod 400 \<YOUR-KEY-NAME\>.pem
ssh -i "<YOUR-KEY-NAME>.pem" ubuntu@\<YOUR-COPIED-PUBLIC-IPv4-ADDRESS\>
```

Fill the fields as per your own details, for example in my case the commands would look like

```zsh
chmod 400 next-aws-deploy.pem
ssh -i "next-aws-deploy.pem" ubuntu@ec2-44-201-126-205.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

Click on `yes` and if everything goes right then you should see a similar shell like this on your terminal

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-84-153:~$
```

Congrats!! You have successfully logged into your EC2 instance ‚ö°Ô∏è.

## Setting up server on EC2 instance

Now that your have your SSH shell open, run the following command

```bash
sudo apt update
```

We need to install Nginx to server our app, you can read more about it [here](https://www.nginx.com/). To intall Nginx run

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

Next we'll need Node.js in our Ubuntu machine to run the Next app. We will install Node using NVM, which is a version manager for Node. Please follow the official [docs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install NVM and Node or follow the following commands

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts
```

The above will install the latest stable version of Node and npm in our machine.

We will use PM2 process manager to run our Next app in the background, you can install it by running

```bash
npm i -g pm2
```

### Configuring swap space in memory

Now, since we are on free-tier and we only have 1GB of RAM for our instance, we might run into memory error while building our Next app, so we need to configure swap space in order to prevent that scenario beforehand. Swap is a virtual memory, which basically uses a chunk of your hard disk space when it runs out of RAM, you can read more about it if you want.

To configure swap space, run

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Now if you run `free -h` in your shell you should be able to see something like

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668515886811/BKtwuxuUc.png"
  alt="linux shell screenshot"
/>

### Configuring Nginx server

To configure our server, run

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.conf
```

This will open a nano editor, paste the following content in it

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Then press `control + x` -> type `y` -> press enter

Now restart your Nginx service using the following command

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Great! Now we have our Nginx setup, if the above command did not throw an error, you're good to go, otherwise please go through the steps again, or check whether you missed any semicolons in `example.conf` file.

## Setting up CI/CD with GitHub actions

Now, head over to your GitHub repo, click on `Actions` on the navbar, search for Node.js and click on `configure` on the `Node.js` workflow

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668518530773/7vzY9y1ES.png"
  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

In the edit tab, paste the following content and click on `Start commit` -> `Commit new file`

```yml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, example]

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
        # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "npm"
      - run: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
      - run: npm run build --if-present
      - run: pm2 restart example
```

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668518841152/sN2s29NNM.png"
  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

Now in the root directory of your project in GitHub, you should have a `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` file

Great! Now let's configure a self-hosted runner which will push and deploy our code in the AWS server every time we push to our `main` branch

In your GitHub repo, go to `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `Runners` -> `New self-hosted runner`

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668519108030/q8MKrUr59.png"
  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

Select `Linux` as runner image. And you should see the following screen

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668519243662/LDFJhJmoL.png"
  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

Copy, paste and run every command in the `Download` box, one by one in your SSH shell where you're connected to the EC2 instance. Your terminal should look something like

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668519474180/3xvp-U3MF.png"
  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

Now copy the 1st command from the `Configure` tab and paste it in terminal

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668519572600/Gytdcjl5j.png"
  alt="github actions screenshot"
/>

A shell prompt should appear after that

- `Enter the name of the runner group to add this runner to: [press Enter for Default]` press enter for this one
- `Enter the name of runner: [press Enter for ip-172-31-84-153]` type "example"
- `This runner will have the following labels: 'self-hosted', 'Linux', 'X64'
Enter any additional labels (ex. label-1,label-2): [press Enter to skip]` type "example"
- `Enter name of work folder: [press Enter for _work]` press enter

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668519811733/u3GQWtM2x.png"
  alt="shell screenshot"
/>

Then, paste the following commands

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

At this point if you run `ls`, you should see a `_work` folder, in case you don't, just go to your local project, change something, `add` -> `commit` -> `push`, which will trigger a deployment and the `_wok` folder should appear

Now run

```bash
cd _work
cd \<YOUR-GITHUB-PROJECT-NAME\>
cd \<YOUR-GITHUB-PROJECT-NAME\>
pm2 start npm --name "example" -- start
```

Replace \<YOUR-GITHUB-PROJECT-NAME\> with _your own project name_, you can use `ls` to check the name, which in my case is

```bash
cd _work
cd next-aws-deploy
cd next-aws-deploy
pm2 start npm --name "example" -- start
```

Alright, now you should see something like this on your terminal

<Image
  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668520715183/Eqg9u93wj.png"
  alt="shell screenshot"
/>

If you do, then GREAT!! Now, if you're ready to see some magic, copy the public dns address of you instance from your EC2 console, which should look something like `ec2-44-201-126-205.compute-1.amazonaws.com`.

Open a new tab in your browser, and type this url

```
http://<YOUR-PUBLIC-DNS-ADDRESS>:3000/
```

So, in my case, the URL looks something like

```
http://ec2-44-201-126-205.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/
```

  src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668521001253/MBL3KjWgc.png"
  alt="web screenshot"
/>

If you see your app then CONGRATULATIONS!!! üöÄ We have made it.

Our Next app is successfully deployed on AWS EC2, and we have a CI/CD setup in GitHub, so every time you push to your main branch, your code will be deployed to the server.

If you have a custom domain of your own, which you want to configure with the server with SSL certificate, then stay tuned. We will go through it in the next post.

## Thank you for reading.
