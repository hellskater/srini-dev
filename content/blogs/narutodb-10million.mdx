From its inception to the means that contributed to its rapid growth, we'll delve into the key factors that made [NarutoDB.xyz](http://NarutoDB.xyz) stand out in the developer community.

### What is NarutoDB API?

NarutoDB API is a meticulously curated and structured open-source API that provides comprehensive data related to the Naruto universe. It serves as a one-stop solution for developers looking to integrate Naruto-related information into their applications, websites, or projects. With a vast collection of character details, jutsu techniques, villages, and more, NarutoDB API caters to the diverse needs of Naruto fans and developers alike.

### How did we exhaust the request quota of our server with zero to no marketing?

Even if you don't have a dedicated marketing team or a bunch of social media managers or even a DevRel intern to promote our product, as developers there are a couple of things you can ensure to do the bare minimum and let the internet do its work.

1. #### High-quality API design

   From the start, we focused on creating an API that exceeded expectations. By investing time and effort into curating accurate and up-to-date data, organizing it effectively, and ensuring a seamless developer experience, we built a reliable resource that developers could trust and rely on without any cross-checking.

2. #### Search Engine Optimizations (SEO)

   We understood the importance of search engine optimization (SEO) in driving organic traffic and gaining visibility. This is by far the most important factor in making the product reach so many users in a short time. Some of the SEO practices that we followed personally are

   - _Next.js Static Site rendering._
   - _On-page unique metadata on each page._
   - _Unique content for each page of the documentation._
   - _XML sitemap of the complete site for all the pages._
   - _24/7 availability by deploying our frontend on Vercel and backend on Cyclic managed servers._
   - _Backlinks from social media posts and blogs._
   - _Page index monitoring for our domain using Google search console._

   I won't go into explaining how all these work or how to perform them, there are millions of resources on the internet to learn about that. This post is primarily about all techniques that we followed personally that worked wonders for us. Still, if you want to learn more about how to implement them, go check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hellskater/narutodb-website) and give it a star while you're at it âœ¨.
